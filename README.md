# get-recipe

Welcome to GET RECEIPE by falo10

I encourage you to use the code freely, thanks to which you will be able to learn new recipes!

PYTHON 3.10.4 was used to write the code, so I encourage you to update your version if you want the program to work properly

# HOW TO RUN YOUR CODE?

Download two required file from this repository:

getRecipe.py
credentials.py

and save them in the same file path.

To run getRecipe you have to gain your own API KEY
How to do it?

First, you have to register on https://spoonacular.com/food-api (IT IS FREE).
After that, on https://spoonacular.com/food-api/console#Profile - you can check your own API Key, after you click on : Show/Hide API Key   

When you will have your own API KEY, last thing you have to do is to open the file 

credentials.py

and inside this file paste your API KEY instead of: HERE_PUT_YOUR_API_KEY

headers = {
	"x-api-key": "HERE_PUT_YOUR_API_KEY"
	}

After that save credentials.py and enjoy!
